# Iterative Algorithm

This iterative algorithm will show the first m terms of the following number sequence:

**t(n)= t(n-1) + 6*t(n-2) + 5*n**

The sequence has the conditions t(1)=1, t(2)=1 and n>=3. 
The user will be prompted the enter the number of iterations and the result will be shown based on the number sequence. 



The algorithm is created as a part of the university course Discrete Mathematics for Computing.
